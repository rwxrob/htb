This is a random collection of notes related to my work on HackTheBox
challenges. I've only included things for which I need reminders. I've
organized stuff by major grouping.

This repo follows KEG Node conventions (one level deep, mandatory
`README.md` with KEG Mark constraints, optional `data.yaml` and other
files).

* [Getting Started](start) - VPN setup gotchas, etc.
