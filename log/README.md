Working on Appointment. Noticed there is a bit of lag updating the
"connected" web interface after starting the VPN (be patient).

Discovered I was using the non-VIP VPN and had to change the `ovpn` file
that I downloaded.

Took me a while to remember my SQL (it's been about 10 years since I
coded any).
